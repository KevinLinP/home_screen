This is my 'browser homepage' in the same idea as the defunct iGoogle personalized homepage.

This loads every time I open a new tab in my browsers, so its meant to load instantly. I used extensive caching with external APIs, browser-side AppCache (to support Safari), and a Local Storage Javascript library for immediate display of slightly stale data.

This is my first serious foray into ES6 and I'm liking it so far.

### Code Sample Highlights

* Watch me learn React: `app/javascript/packs`
* Wranging a funky API: `app/models/nicehash.rb`
* Trying a different way of using Bootstrap: `app/assets/stylesheets`
